search_docs tool - used by KnowledgeAgent.

Queries the vector store for relevant documentation chunks.
Returns chunk IDs, scores, and content so the agent can cite sources.

TODO for candidate: implement this tool.
Wire it to your chosen vector store (Chroma, LanceDB, FAISS, etc.).

    Search the vector store for top-k relevant chunks.

    Args:
        query: natural language query from the user
        k: number of chunks to return
        product_area: optional metadata filter (e.g. "security", "ci-cd")

    Returns:
        List of DocChunk ordered by descending similarity score.

    Design considerations:
    - How do you embed the query? Same model as at ingest time.
    - Do you apply a score threshold to filter low-quality results?
    - How do you format chunks for the agent? Include chunk_id so agent can cite.
