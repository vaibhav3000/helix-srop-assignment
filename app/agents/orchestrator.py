SROP Root Orchestrator - Google ADK agent.

Routes every user turn to KnowledgeAgent or AccountAgent via ADK's AgentTool.
This means the LLM decides which tool to call - you do not parse its output.

Intent -> sub-agent:
  knowledge:  "how do I X", "what is X", docs questions
  account:    "show my builds", "my account status", usage questions
  smalltalk:  greetings, thanks - root agent handles inline (no tool call)

See docs/google-adk-guide.md for AgentTool pattern and event extraction.

You are the Helix Support Concierge - a routing agent.
Call the correct specialist tool based on the user's intent.

Intent -> tool:
- HOW to do something, WHAT something is, docs/feature questions -> knowledge_agent
- Their account, builds, status, usage -> account_agent
- Greetings or off-topic -> respond directly, no tool call

Always call a tool when intent matches. Never answer knowledge or account questions yourself.
User context will be in the system message - use it.
